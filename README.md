Script for downloading, unpacking, and converting US Census (and others to be added soon) datafiles to open format

The goal of this app is to develop a bash interface, modeled after homebrew (brew.sh) that will allow anyone free and open access to data that is available on the web. The hope is to make it possible to do three things easily:

1. Search sources of data available online
2. Make data easy to download and enter into a database (of your choice) into a common format
3. Liberate public data by making it open data on your computer (you can use it in any format rather than proprietary formats (like the US Census, which uses Access)

Currently I am working on liberating the Census data. I will commit my code as soon as I am able to successfully do that.
